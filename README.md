# TheFirstOne-SOLON
This was the first large commercial project I was commissioned to develop, between the age of 17 and 18. One of our adjecent neighbors had an calculation service for architects and contractors (building construction) from the late 80's to the late 90's, and would do measurements and quantity takeoff calculations on their behalf. The software I developed was a software for organizing and calucating construction titles/positions and for calculating measurements for these organizational units.

## Development equipment

My development machine was a Nixdorf PC 8810/M55:

* Intel 286 running at 10 MHZ (that was amazingly fast at the time!)
* EGA graphics card.
* 1 MB main memory
* Running Dos 3.3

We developed with

* Microsoft C Compiler
* Microsoft Assembler
* Microsoft Basic 6.0 Compiler
* Microsoft QuickBasic

We used 2 partitions on the machine.

* **C: User Test environment:** Everything there was as we would later deploy the software to the customers.
* **D: Development environsment:** This was our Development environment and hosted all the compilers, tools and source code.

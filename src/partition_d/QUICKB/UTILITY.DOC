     Release notes for the Microsoft CodeView(R) debugger and utilities

	       (C) Copyright Microsoft Corporation 1987, 1988

This document contains information about the Microsoft CodeView(R) debugger and
utilities for MS-DOS(R) and the Microsoft Operating System/2 (MS OS/2). The
information contained in this document is more up to date than the information
in the printed manuals. Where information in the manuals conflicts with this
document, you should assume that this document contains the correct
information.

Microsoft improves its language documentation at the time of reprinting, so
some of the information in this on-line file may already be included in your
manuals.

========================< The Mouse Driver >===================================

If you will be using the Microsoft Mouse with the Microsoft CodeView debugger
you must have Version 6.0 or later of the Microsoft Mouse. If you do not,
use the version of the MOUSE.COM driver provided in this package.  Copy
MOUSE.COM to the appropriate mouse directory. When you are ready to use the
mouse, type

	mouse

at the DOS command level. If you want to install the mouse driver automatically
every time you reboot,  insert the "mouse" command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Note that in earlier releases of Microsoft C, both the MOUSE.SYS and the
MOUSE.COM driver were provided.  If you have been using an earlier version
of the MOUSE.SYS driver, delete the following line from your CONFIG.SYS file:

	device=\<directory>\mouse.sys

where <directory> is the directory where the earlier mouse driver resides.


====================< Microsoft CodeView Debugger >============================

New Command-Line Option
-----------------------
If you have an IBM Personal System/2, then you can use the /50
command-line option to start the CodeView debugger in 50-line mode.
Note that you must be in 25-line mode to effectively use either the
/43 or /50 command-line option.

CONFIG.SYS Setting for CVP
--------------------------
To run the protected-mode CodeView debugger (CVP.EXE), you must have
the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

	IOPL=YES


Using the 7 Command in Protected Mode
-------------------------------------
If you are using OS/2 protected mode and have a math coprocessor, then
you need to use a patch before you can use the CVP 7 command.  To apply
the patch, use the OS2PATCH.EXE and PTRACE87.PAT files that come on the
same disk that CVP.EXE is on.  You also need to locate the PATCH.EXE file
that comes with OS/2 and make sure that this file is in a directory listed
in your PATH environment variable.  Then follow these steps:

1) Change the current drive and directory to the root directory of the
   boot disk.  (If the boot disk is a floppy, make sure it is inserted
   in the drive you used to boot from.)

2) Give the following command line at the DOS prompt:

   OS2PATCH /A PTRACE87.PAT

Note that you may need to give the complete path names for the
OS2PATCH.EXE and for the PTRACE87.PAT file.  You do not need to give
a path name for the OS2PATCH.EXE file if you have placed this file
in a directory listed in your PATH environment variable.

Using the Real-Mode Debugger in the Compatibility Box
-----------------------------------------------------
When running the real-mode CodeView debugger in the DOS 3.x
compatibility box, start the debugger with the /S command-line
option.  Otherwise, the mouse pointer will not appear.

Using the CodeView Debugger with BIND
-------------------------------------
The real-mode CodeView debugger cannot debug bound (dual-mode)
applications.  However, the protected-mode CodeView debugger,
CVP, can debug bound applications.

Compiling BASIC Programs for CodeView Debugger
----------------------------------------------
To compile BASIC programs for use with the CodeView debugger, specify the
/Zi option rather than the /D option.

Expression Evaluator for BASIC Programs
---------------------------------------
In the BASIC expression evaluator, "+" is not supported for string
concatenation.

Stack Trace Command
-------------------
In order for the Stack Trace command (or the Calls menu) to work
reliably, you need to execute to at least the beginning of the main
function or procedure, and the current module should have full CodeView
information (a module has full CodeView information if compiled or
assembled with /Zi).

Error Messages
--------------
The error message "? cannot display" indicates that the Display
Expression command (?) has been passed a valid symbol that it
cannot display. In previous versions of the debugger, structures
could not be displayed. With current version of the debugger, only
the enums type cannot be displayed.

The error message "Expression not a memory address" occurs when
the Tracepoint command is given without a symbol that evaulates to
a single memory address.  For example, the commands "TP?1" and
"TP?a+b" each produce this error message.  The proper way to put a
tracepoint on the word at address 1 is with the command "TPW 1".

The error message "Function call before 'main'" occurs when you
attempt to evaluate a program-defined function before you have entered
the main function.  Execute to at least to the beginning of the main
function before attempting to evaluate program-defined functions.

The error message "Bad emulator info" occurs when CodeView cannot
read data from the floating-point emulator.

The error message "Floating point not loaded" has a special meaning
for CVP (in addition to the explanation given in the CodeView and
Utilities manual).  Each thread has its own floating-point emulator.
This message is issued when the current thread has not initialized
its own emulator.

Microsoft Pascal Programs
-------------------------
In this release, Microsoft Pascal programs cannot be debugged with
the CodeView debugger.


The Pascal example on pg. 61 of the Microsoft CodeView and Utilities
manual should read 

	PAS1 /Zz TEST;

rather than

	PAS1 /Zi TEST;

=========================< Exit Codes for Utilities >==========================

The exit codes for LINK and the utilities in the Microsoft CodeView
and Utilities manual should appear as follows:

LINK
----
	Code	Meaning

	0	No error.

	2	Program error--something was wrong with the commands
		or files input to the linker.

	4	System error.  The linker

		- ran out of space on output files
		- was unable to reopen the temporary file
		- experienced an internal error
		- was interrupted by the user

LIB, EXEPACK, EXEMOD, MAKE, and SETENV
---------------------------------------
	Code	Meaning

	0	No error.

	2	Program error--something was wrong with the commands
		or files input to the utility.

	4	System error.  The utility ran out of memory, was
		interrupted by the user, or experienced an internal
		error.

==================< Microsoft Overlay Linker (LINK) >==========================

Overlay Restrictions
--------------------
You cannot use long jumps (using the longjmp library function) or indirect
calls (through a function pointer) to pass control to an overlay.  When a
function is called through a pointer, the called function must be in the same
overlay or in the root.

Changed LINK Error Messages
---------------------------
The explanation for fatal-error message L1008 is changed as follows: 

	The /SEGMENTS option specified a limit greater than 3072 on the
	number of segments allowed.

Error message L1009 has been changed to read as follows:

	L1009	<number> : CPARMAXALLOC : illegal value

Error message L1053 has been changed to read as follows:

	L1053   out of memory for symbol table

	The program had more symbolic information (such as public, external,
	segment, group, class, and file names) than the amount that could fit
	in  available real memory.

	Try freeing memory by linking from the DOS command level instead of
	from a MAKE file or from an editor. Otherwise, combine modules or
	segments and try to eliminate as many public symbols as possible.

Warning message L4050 has been changed as follows:

	L4050	too many public symbols for sorting

	The linker uses the stack and all available memory in the
	near heap to sort public symbols for the /MAP option.  If
	the number of public symbols exceeds the space available
	for them, this warning is issued, and the symbols are not
	sorted in the map file but are listed in arbitrary order.

New LINK Error Messages
-----------------------
L1003	/QUICKLIB, /EXEPACK incompatible

You cannot link with both the /QU option and the /E option.

L1006   <option-text>: stack size exceeds 65535 bytes

The value given as a parameter to the /STACKSIZE option exceeds the
maximum allowed.

L1063	out of memory for CodeView information

The linker was given too many object files with debug information,
and the linker ran out of space to store it.  Reduce the number
of object files that have debug information.

L1115   /QUICKLIB, overlays incompatible

You specified overlays and used the /QUICKLIB option.
These cannot be used together.

L2013	LIDATA record too large

An LIDATA record contained more than 512 bytes.  This is
probably a compiler error.

L2024   <name>: special symbol already defined

Your program defined a symbol name that is already used by the linker
for one of its own low-level symbols.  (For example, the linker
generates special symbols used in overlay support and other operations.)
Choose another name for the symbol in order to avoid conflict.

L2025   <segmentname>: segment with > 1 class name not allowed with /INC

Your program defined a segment more than once, giving the segment
different class names.  Different class names for the same segment
are not allowed when you link with the /INCREMENTAL option.  Normally,
this error should never appear unless you are programming with MASM.
For example, if you give the two MASM statements

_BSS segment 'BSS'

and

_BSS segment 'DATA'

then the statements have the effect of declaring two distinct segments.
ILINK does not support this situation, so it is disallowed when the
/INCREMENTAL option is used.


L2041	stack plus data exceed 64K

The total of near data and requested stack size exceeds 64K, 
and the program will not run correctly.  Reduce the stack size.
The linker only checks for this condition if /DOSSEG
is enabled, which is done automatically in the library
startup module.

L2043	Quick Library support module missing

When creating a Quick library, you did not link with the required
QUICKLIB.OBJ module.

L2044	<name> : symbol	multiply defined, use /NOE

The linker found what it interprets as a public-symbol
redefinition, probably because you have redefined a symbol that
is defined in a library.  Relink with the /NOEXTDICTIONARY
(/NOE) option. If error L2025 results for the same symbol, then you
have a genuine symbol-redefinition error.

L4003	intersegment self-relative fixup at <offset> in segment <name>
	pos: <offset> Record type: 9C target external '<name>'

The linker found an intersegment self-relative fixup. This error
may be caused by compiling a small-model program with the /NT
option. 

L4034	more than 239 overlay segments; extra put in root

Your program designated more than the limit of 239 segments to 
go in overlays.  Starting with the 234th segment, they are assigned to 
the root (that is, the permanently resident portion of the program).


==============< Microsoft Library Manager (LIB) >==============================

New Option
----------
There is a new option for LIB:  /NOIGNORECASE (abbreviated as /N).
This option tells LIB to not ignore case when comparing symbols.
names. By default, LIB ignores case.  Multiple symbols that are
the same except for case can be put in the same library.  An
example of this is: "_Open" and "_open". Normally you could not
add both these symbols to the same library.

Note that if a library is built with /NOI, the library is
internally "marked" to indicate /NOI.	All libraries built
with earlier versions of LIB are not marked.

If you combine multiple libraries, and any one of them is
marked /NOI, then /NOI is assumed for the output library.

In addition, LIB also supports the option /IGNORECASE (/I), which
is completely analagous to /NOIGNORECASE.  /I is the default. The only
reason to use it would be if you have an existing library marked /NOI
that you wanted to combine with other libraries which were not marked,
and have the output library be not marked. If you don't use
/IGNORECASE, the output is marked /NOI (see above).

Changed LIB Error Messages
--------------------------
Warning	messages U4152,	U4155, and U4157-U4159 for LIB are now
nonfatal error messages	U2152, U2155, and U2157-U2159, respectively.

Warning message U4151 has been changed to read as follows:

	U4151	'<name>' : symbol defined in module <name>, redefinition ignored

New LIB Error Messages
----------------------
The following new warning messages have	been added for LIB:

U4155	<modulename> : module not in library

A module specified to be replaced does not already exist in the 
library.  LIB adds the module anyway.

U4157	insufficient memory, extended dictionary not created
U4158	internal error,	extended dictionary not	created

For the	reason indicated, LIB could not	create an extended
dictionary. The	library	is still valid,	but the	linker
is not able to take advantage of the extended dictionary
to speed linking. 


==============< Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (MAKE) >=================

New Error Message
-----------------
U1015: <file> : error redirection failed

This error occurs if the /X option is given and error output cannot
be redirected to the given file (for example, because the file
is read-only).

Inference Rules
---------------
You cannot have inference rules in both the TOOLS.INI and the description
file that use both the same inextension and outextension.  For example, you
cannot place the following inference rule in the TOOLS.INI file:

	.c.obj:
		cl /c /Zi /Od $*.c

while also placing the following line in the description file:

	.c.obj:
		cl /Ot $*.c

However, you can define the same macro in both the TOOLS.INI and the
description file.  In such cases, the definition in the description file
takes precedence.

Backslash (\) as Continuation Character
---------------------------------------
Note that MAKE considers a backslash immediately followed by a new-line
character to be a continuation character.  When it finds this combination
in a description file, MAKE concatenates the line immediately following
the combination with the line where the combination appears.

If you define a macro that ends in a backslash, make sure that you put a
space after the terminating backslash.  For example, if you want to define
macros for the path C:\SRC\BIN and C:\SRC\LIB, you must use the format 
illustrated below:

	BINPATH=C:\SRC\BIN\<space><newline>
	LIBPATH=C:\SRC\LIB\<space><newline>

To illustrate the problems that can result if you do not put a space before the
new-line character, assume that the macros above appear as shown below
instead: 

	BINPATH=C:\SRC\BIN\<newline>
	LIBPATH=C:\SRC\LIB\<newline>

Because a new-line character appears immediately after the backslash at the end
of the first macro, MAKE assumes that you are defining the single macro shown
below:

	BINPATH=C:\SRC\BIN\LIBPATH=C:\SRC\LIB\



=============< Microsoft STDERR Redirection Utility (ERROUT) >=================

The ERROUT utility does not accept batch files. To redirect standard-error
output from a batch file, you must enter a command of the following form:

	ERROUT COMMAND /c <batchcommand> 

If no /f option is given, then ERROUT redirects standard-error output to
the standard-output device.


======================< Mixed-Language Programming >===========================

C Naming Conventions
--------------------
C recognizes the first 31 characters of a symbolic name. 

Accessing Parameters on the Stack
---------------------------------
In Section 6.1.5 of the Microsoft Mixed Languages Programming Guide, the
instruction

	mov	bx, [bp+6]

loads the argument into the BX register rather than the BP register.

Setting Up Calls to High-Level Languages
----------------------------------------
Section 6.6 of the Microsoft Mixed Languages Programming Guide gives in-
structions for setting up a call to a high-level language from assembly
language.  Before you execute a call to a BASIC, Pascal, or FORTRAN routine,
remember to declare an additional parameter if the return value is noninteger.
This additional parameter must contain the offset address of the return value,
for which you must allocate room within the stack segment (normally DGROUP,
the same as the default data segment).

BASIC Return Values
-------------------
BASIC functions use the FORTRAN/Pascal conventions, rather than the C
conventions, for receiving return values. 

Passing C Strings to BASIC
--------------------------
In Section 8.4.3 of the Microsoft Mixed Languages Programming Guide, in the example
illustrating how C passes string arguments to BASIC functions, the sd_len
field should be declared as shown below:

	int sd_len
 
BASIC Array Declarations
------------------------
The sample BASIC array declaration in Table 9.1 of the Microsoft
Mixed Language Guide should read

	DIM x(c-1, r-1)

Linking with MASM Files
-----------------------
If you are linking C modules with modules created by the Microsoft Macro
Assembler, either assemble the MASM modules with the /MX option to
preserve case sensitivity in these modules; or, use the LINK command
to link in a separate step, and do NOT specify the /NOI linker
option.

Linking Mixed-Language Programs
-------------------------------
This section explains how to link Microsoft C modules with modules created 
by other Microsoft languages.  The discussions assume that you are linking
with Version 3.61 of the Microsoft Overlay Linker, LINK.  (This is the version
of LINK provided with Version 5.10 of the Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler.)

To link object modules created using the Microsoft C Optimizinng Compiler,
Version 5.10, with those created using the Microsoft FORTRAN Optimizing
Compiler Version 4.00 or 4.01, you must create a special version of each
of the FORTRAN libraries you intend to use. Create one FORTRAN library
to correspond to each C library you are using; that is, create a FORTRAN
library that supports the same memory-model/math-option combination as
the corresponding C library. Be sure that you choose the "C compatibility"
option when you build each FORTRAN library.

Next, use the SETUP program provided with Microsoft C, Version 5.10, to
create all the combined C 5.10 libraries that you will need.  SETUP creates
a subdirectory named \MIXLANG under the C 5.10 base directory.

Place the FORTRAN libraries you have created in this directory. Then make the
\MIXLANG directory the current directory and run F4COMPAT, which brings the
FORTRAN libraries up to date and makes them compatible with C 5.10.  F4COMPAT
takes two arguments: one specifying the memory model and one specifying the
floating-point-math package that the library supports. For example,

	F4COMPAT L 7

makes a C 5.10-compatible version of LLIBFOR7.LIB.

Once the libraries are built, use the following LINK command line to
link the appropriate C library with the FORTRAN library that you
converted in the previous example:	

     LINK objs,,,LLIBC7.LIB LLIBFOR7.LIB /NOE;

The LINK command lines for other memory models and floating-point math packages
are similar.  Note that the C library must be given first on the command line. 
Specify the \MIXLANG subdirectory either in the LIB environment variable
or on the LINK command line so that the linker can find the FORTRAN
library. Use only large- and medium-model libraries.  Huge-model programs
use large-model libraries.


To link other combinations of language libraries, the BASIC libraries
(either BCOM40 or BRUN40) should be listed first on the LINK command
line, since the main program must be written in BASIC.  Otherwise,
the C 5.1 library should be listed first. (Or, if you are using C 4.0
with FORTRAN 4.0 or later, the FORTRAN library should be listed first.)
For best results, using large-memory-model C is suggested.


=====================< The BIND Utility >======================================

Specifying Libraries
--------------------
You need to include DOSCALLS.LIB on the BIND command line. If
DOSCALLS.LIB is not in the current directory, you must give the 
complete path name to DOSCALLS.LIB.

BIND automatically searches for API.LIB by looking in directories
listed in the LIB environment variable.  However, if API.LIB is
specified on the command line, then BIND does not check the LIB
environment variable; instead, you need to give the complete
path name.

For example, the following command line successfully uses BIND, if
API.LIB is located in a directory listed in the LIB environment
variable:

BIND FOO.EXE \LIB\DOSCALLS.LIB

Using BIND with Packed Files
----------------------------
The version of BIND released with this package does not work with
files that have been linked with the /EXEPACK linker option.

Running Bound Files with DOS 2.1
--------------------------------
A dual-mode executable file produced with BIND can be run in both
DOS 3.x and DOS 2.x environments.  However, if you change the name
of an executable file produced by BIND, then it will not run under
DOS 2.1.


===============< The Microsoft Incremental Linker (ILINK) >====================

ILINK Fatal Error Messages
--------------------------

.sym seek error
.sym read error

	The .SYM file is corrupted.  Do a full link.  If the error

	are running ILINK under MAKE, try running it from the shell.
	Otherwise, do a full link.

could not run exec

	ILINK was unable to find the file EXEC.EXE, which should be
	placed somewhere in the search path or in the current
	directory.

.exe file too big, change alignment

	The segment sector alignment value in the .EXE file is too
	small to express the size of one of the segments.  Do a full
	link and increase the alignment value with the /ALIGNMENT
	option to LINK.

.ilk seek error

	The .ILK file is corrupted.  Do a full link.  If the error
	persists, contact Microsoft.

Too many defined segments

	ILINK has a limit of 255 defined segments, which are segments
	defined in an object module as opposed to an executable segment.
	Reduce the number of segments if you want to use ILINK.

too many library files

	ILINK has a limit of 32 runtime libraries (.LIB files).  Reduce
	the number of libraries.

too many modules

	ILINK has a limit of 1204 modules in a program.  Reduce the
	number of modules.

.ilk write error

	The disk is full, or else ILINK cannot write to the .SYM file

file <name> invalid .OBJ format
file <name> has invalid <recordtype> record

	The given .OBJ file has an invalid format or one that is not
	recognized by ILINK.  This may have been caused by a compiler
	or assembler.

file <module> was not full linked

	An .OBJ file was specified as input to ILINK, which was not in
	the list of files in the original full link.

LOBYTE seg-relative fixups not supported

	This error message should occur only with MASM files.  See the
	Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.0 Programmer's Guide. This type of
	object module is not supported by ILINK.

<number> undefined symbols

	The given number of symbols were referred to in fixups but

	The program starting address changed.  You may want to consider
	doing a full link.


===========================< Microsoft Editor >================================

Installing the Editor
---------------------
The Microsoft Editor does not come with an MESETUP program. Instead,
run the setup program for the compiler. This program offers you choices
about how to set up the editor.

Keystroke Configurations
------------------------
Some of the keystroke configurations listed in Table A.2 of the
Microsoft Editor User's Guide may need to be changed.

In the Quick/WordStar configuration, the Sinert function is assigned
to ALT+INS, not CTRL+INS.

In the BREIF configuration, the Plines function is assigned to ALT+D,
and the Refresh function is assigned to CTRL+].

In the EPSILON configuration, the Ppage function is assigned to PGDN,
and the Sdelete function is assigned to DEL and CTRL+D.

The Compile Function
--------------------
The commands

	Arg streamarg Compile
        Arg textarg Compile

each use the command specified by the extmake:text switch.  The
editor does not check the extension of the file name given as an
argument, but instead uses the "text" extension.  The streamarg
or textarg replaces a %s in the command.  These commands are typically
used to invoke MAKE.

The Setfile Function
--------------------
The commands that use Setfile, along with a streamarg or textarg,
accept a variety of input: either the name of a file, a file name
with a wild-card character (* or ?), the name of a directory, or the
name of a disk drive.  File names can also include environment variables,
such as $INIT.  If the streamarg or textarg is a directory name, then
the editor changes the current directory.  If the argument is a drive
name, then the editor changes the current drive.  Environment variables
are translated into directories to be searched for a file.  For example,
the following macro directs the editor to search the $INIT environment
variable in order to find the tools.ini file:

    tools.ini := Arg "$TOOLS:tools.ini" Setfile


Entering Strings in Macros
--------------------------
When you enter a text argument directly, no characters have special
meaning (except when the argument is interpreted as a regular
expression).  However, when you enter text as part of a macro, then
strings inside of quotes are interpreted according to the C string
format.  This format uses a backslash followed by double quotes (\")
to represent double quotes and it uses two backslashes (\\) to represent
a single backslash.  Therefore, to find the next occurrence of the string

    She wrote, "Here is a blackslash: \ "

you could use the following macro definition:

    findit := Arg "She wrote, \"Here is a backslash: \\ \"" Psearch

Note that to indicate a backslash for a regular expression that is
also part of a macro definition, you must use four consecutive
backslashes.


Using Text Switches
-------------------
The text switches extmake and readonly each take a special
kind of sytax that allows you to specify drive, file name,
base name, or file extension. The syntax consists of the
characters:

%|<letters>F

where <letters> consists of any of the following: "p" for path,
"d" for drive, "f" for file base name, or "e" for file extension.
For example, if you are editing the file c:\dir1\sample.c, and you
make the following switch assignment:

extmake:c cl /Fod:%|pfF %|dfeF

then each time you give the command <Arg><Compile>, the editor
performs the following system-level command:

cl /Fod:\dir1\sample c:sample.c

The expression "%s" is equivalent to "%|feF" except that the former
only works once, whereas the latter can appear any number of times
in the extmake switch assignment. The expression "%|F" is equivalent
to "%|dpfeF".

The Filetab Switch
------------------
The filetab switch is a numeric switch that determines how the
editor translates tabs when loading a file into memory.  The value
of the switch gives the number of spaces associated with each tab
column.  For example, the setting "filetab:4" assumes a tab column
every 4 positions on each line.  Every time the editor finds a tab
character in a file, it loads the buffer with the number of spaces
necessary to get to the next tab column.  Depending on the value of
the entab switch, the editor also uses the filetab switch to determine
how to convert spaces into tabs when writing to a file.  The default
value of filetab is 8.

Functions Callable by C Extensions
----------------------------------

The following list summarizes functions from the standard compact-
memory-model library, which should work when called by a C-extension
module.  (The technique of programming C extensions is presented in 
Chapter 8 of the Microsoft Editor User's Guide.)  The memory model
of the extension is assumed to be /Asfu (small code pointers, far
data pointers, and stack segment unequal to data segment).  This list
uses the function categories from Chapter 4 of the Microsoft C
Optimizing Compiler Run-Time Library Reference (Version 4.0
or later.)

Buffer Manipulation: All functions can be called.

Character Classification and Conversion: All functions can be called.

Data Conversion: All functions can be called except for

     strtod()

Directory Control: All functions can be called except for

     getcwd()

File Handling: All functions can be called.

Low-Level I/O Routines: All functions can be called, but write()
will not work in binary mode.

Console and Port I/O: All functions can be called except for

     cgets()

     _searchenv()


Linking Extensions in Protected Mode
--------------------------------------
To link C extension modules in protected mode, link with the
object file EXTHDRP.OBJ, instead of the real-mode header
EXTHDR.OBJ.

THIS FILE CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT INSTALLING MICROSOFT BASIC
COMPILER VERSION 6.0. PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE FILE BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT TO
INSTALL THIS PRODUCT.


BASIC Compiler Version 6.0 Setup Utility
------------------------------------------------------------

The setup program (SETUP.EXE) installs BASIC Compiler Version 6.0 files on
your system from the backup copies of your BASIC 6.0 distribution disks. It
also builds combined libraries. This file provides additional information
about using the SETUP program.

Default Directories
-------------------

When installing BASIC 6.0 on your hard disk drive, SETUP can use five
different directories, as described in the following list. (SETUP suggests
default names for these directories, but you may use different names if you
like.)

1. The "bound executable" directory contains programs that can run under both
   DOS and OS/2. These include the compiler, linker, and various utilities.

2. The "real-mode and DOS executable" directory contains utilities and run-
   time modules that run only under DOS (OS/2 real mode).

3. The "protected binary" directory contains utilities and run-time modules
   that run only under OS/2 protected mode.

4. The "library" directory contains BASIC 6.0 library files and Quick
   libraries for QuickBASIC Version 4.0.

5. The "work" directory contains BASIC example programs and other files such
   as special-purpose object files and initialization files.

When you run SETUP, it creates each of the preceding directories if they do
not already exist. If a given directory already exists, SETUP copies the
appropriate files into that directory (and may overwrite existing files with
the same names as the files being copied).

The following files are not copied to your hard disk by the SETUP program
because they are needed only in special cases. See the file README.DOC for an
explanation of the two COM files.

    QBHERC.COM
    FIXSHIFT.COM


Starting the SETUP Program
------------------------------------------------------------

To use the SETUP program, insert the disk labeled "Program Disk" and issue
the following command:

    SETUP

(In addition to installing the BASIC Compiler Version 6.0, SETUP can create
new combined libraries. This is done by running SETUP with the /L option as
described in "Building Libraries" later in this document.)

The SETUP program is largely self prompting: using onscreen prompts, it
guides you through the entire process of installing BASIC Version 6.0.
In this process, SETUP asks several questions about the files that it will
copy to your hard disk and the directories where it will copy those files.

Each question has a default value that appears inside a pair of square
brackets ([]). If the default value is satisfactory, you can choose it simply
by pressing ENTER. If you want some other value, you can type that value at
the cursor. As you type, SETUP checks each character to make sure it is legal
for that particular value. If you type an illegal character, SETUP creates a
warning beep and allows you to type another character. SETUP also checks
the entire response after you finish entering it. If the response is not
valid, SETUP displays an error message at the bottom of the screen and
invites you to try again.

After you answer all of the questions, SETUP asks whether you wish to change
any of your choices. If you answer Yes by typing Y, then SETUP allows you to
enter new responses. To simplify this process, SETUP uses your previous
answers as the default response for each item. This allows you to move quickly
through the questions to the response that you want to change.

After you indicate that all of your responses are correct, SETUP proceeds to
copy files from the BASIC Version 6.0 floppy disks to your hard disk. It
asks you to insert each disk when needed, and press a key when you are ready.
For each file that it copies, SETUP displays the name of the file and the
directory where it is being copied.

Component Libraries
------------------------------------------------------------

After it copies all the needed files from the BASIC 6.0 floppy disks to your
hard-disk drive, SETUP builds one or more combined libraries. A combined
library is a file that contains one or more component libraries, depending on
your choices for target operating environment and floating-point method. It
is much faster to link a single combined library than to separately link the
component libraries that it contains.

After SETUP finishes building combined libraries, it normally deletes the
component libraries used to make each combined library. You will not usually
need the component libraries after the combined library exists, and they
occupy a significant amount of disk space.

Environment Variables
------------------------------------------------------------

Like other Microsoft language compilers, BASIC Compiler Version 6.0 can use
environment variables to locate various files while it works. To help you
correctly set these variables, SETUP creates two files containing appropriate
commands. These files are placed in the directory that you designate as the
"work directory" (see above). Two files are created: one for DOS (OS/2 real
mode) and the other for OS/2 protected mode. The DOS file is named
NEW-PATH.BAT, and the OS/2 protected-mode file is named NEW-PATH.CMD. Each
of these can be run as a batch file. However, it will be more convenient for
you to copy the commands from the file to the appropriate startup file for
the operating environment. The next two paragraphs explain how this is done
for each file.

NEW.PATH.BAT: This file is for use in DOS (OS/2 real mode). If you copy the
file's commands into the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in the root directory of your hard
drive, then the environment variables will be set automatically when you boot
under DOS or start a real-mode session in OS/2.

NEW-PATH.CMD: This file is for use in OS/2 protected mode. It can be run as a
normal batch file. However, it is more convenient to run it automatically when
you initiate a protected-mode session. This is done by placing the file's
commands in the file that is automatically executed by the /K command in the
PROTSHELL line of your CONFIG.SYS file. See the Microsoft Operating System/2
Beginning User's Guide for more information about CONFIG.SYS.

System Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------

SETUP also creates a file named NEW-CONF.SYS, which contains commands that
provide enough buffers and files to run the BASIC Compiler Version 6.0. You
should copy this file's commands into your existing CONFIG.SYS file.

Deleting SETUP1.BAT and SETUP1.CMD
------------------------------------------------------------

The last task that SETUP performs is to create the default BASIC run-time
modules. This is done by creating a batch file named SETUP1.BAT for DOS and
OS/2 real mode or SETUP1.CMD for OS/2 protected mode. Once SETUP is done
working, this batch file serves no purpose and can be deleted.

Building Libraries
------------------------------------------------------------

Building combined libraries is a normal part of the installation process.
After installing the BASIC Compiler 6.0, however, you may decide that you
need an additional combined library. While it is possible to build another
combined library by hand, using the LIB utility and referring to the BASIC
6.0 documentation, it is more convenient to build the library with SETUP. To
use SETUP in this way, insert the disk named "Program Disk" and enter the
following command:

	SETUP /L

If you invoke SETUP with the /L option, it allows you to create combined
libraries without repeating other steps in the installation process. When
used in this way, SETUP asks the same library-related questions that it asks
when you install BASIC 6.0. However, it allows you to specify a different
source for the component libraries that make up the combined library.

Thus, if you chose to retain the component libraries when you originally
installed BASIC 6.0, you can specify the directory where those files reside
as the source directory for building the new combined library. If SETUP is
not able to find a given component library, it prompts you to specify a new
place where that component can be found. If the component is no longer on
your hard disk drive, you can specify a floppy disk drive. Note, however, that
once you specify a floppy-disk drive as the source, you must read all the
remaining component libraries from a floppy disk.
